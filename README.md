- 👋 Hi, I’m @MiSTerFPGA
- 👀 I’m interested in GPL compliance in the MiSTerFPGA project. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to interact with peers in the MiSTerFPGA community to encourage GPL compliance. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/SD-Installer-Win64_MiSTer tarballs to be GPL complaint with included build scripts, and associated source code.
- 📫 How to reach me: license-violation@gnu.org, or https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.en.html
